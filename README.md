# calc
Small CLI calculator that can calculate a basic mathematical expression when passed as an argument without spaces.
Since I wanted to learn C, I started this project with the intention of becoming comfortable with the C language,
while also creating what I was missing in a tiling window manager setup: a lightweight cli calculator written in C.
While working on this project, I have realised how valuable it is to have a clear image of what you want to create when coding a program, but I also
discovered that programming in C makes you think in a very fundamental manner.
